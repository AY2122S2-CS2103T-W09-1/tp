### Project: UniGenda

UniGenda is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are an NUS student,
and you can type fast, UniGenda can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view contacts by tag
    * What it does: Allows the user to be able to view all contacts that share a particular tag(inputted by the user)
    * Justification: This feature is necessary for the user to be able to see people that share a particular tag. It would be a useful feature as users would want to know which contacts have a particular tag attached to them(as they may be part of a similar group)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view free common timings that people are free based on a date and tag input by the user
    * What it does: Shows the user which timings those who share a particular tag are free on a particular day, based on a tag and date input by the user
    * Justification: A user would want to know when their contacts from the saame group of friends(hence taking those with the same tag) would be free on a particular day to organise a meetup.
