### Project: UniGenda

UniGenda is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are an NUS student, and you can type fast, UniGenda can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
