### Project: UniGenda

UniGenda is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are an NUS student, and you can type fast, UniGenda can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit events
    * What it does: Allows user to be able to edit any attribute of an event without deleting and adding.
    * Justification: An `Event` has many attributes to it, e.g. `EventDescription`, `Date`, `Time`, e.t.c. If a user made a mistake while adding event, even though the target user can type fast, it is still inconvenient for the user to type duplicate events if the user only made a minor mistake for one of the attributes. Therefore, allowing the user to edit an event without having to type a lot will make the user experience much better than without this feature.
    * Highlights: This feature was relatively easy to implement, however, it was also rather time-consuming. It was done at the beginning of the project, thus understanding the existing code took most of the time. The area that was hard to understand was the 

* **New Feature**: Added the feature to find who is free with given date and time
    * What it does: Allows user to find who, in user's address book, is free given the user's date and time input. 
    * Justification: This is a main feature of our application. This feature provides convenience and better planning for the user.
    * Highlights: 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to export schedule
    * What it does: Allows user to share schedules.
    * Justification: This feature is used together with the ability to import schedule, which Yan Han handled. It improves the efficiency of creating new schedules. Users would only have to create their own schedules, and they can export their schedules for sharing. And together with the ability to import schedules, users can use the shared exported file to update the schedules of their contacts. Reducing the number of events that they have to create, improving the user experience for the application.
    * Highlights: 
    
* **Improved Feature**: Improved the expected upcoming dates for recurring events
  * What it does:

* **Project management**:
    * Facilitated team meetings and ensured that meeting agendas are met for each meeting.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * to be added soon

      * Added documentation for the features `editEvent`, `whoIsFree` and `exportSchedule`.
    * Developer Guide:
      * Added documentation for `whoIsFree` and `exportSchedule` features.
